Orange juice appears to also be more effective at lower doses than for the equivalent dose of ascorbic acid. However, this difference is less prominent when higher doses were administered.\n\n# Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing\n\n```{r ttest}\nt.test(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth)\n```\n\nFrom these results, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the supplement type has no effect on length.\n\nWe will now perorm a similar test, using the dose as a factor. For this, we will subset the data into 3 groups of dose combinations and perform tests between them.\n\n```{r}\nt.test(len ~ dose, data = ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose != 0.5)) # 1.0 and 2.0\nt.test(len ~ dose, data = ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose != 1.0)) # 0.5 and 2.0\nt.test(len ~ dose, data = ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose != 2.0)) # 0.5 and 1.0\n```\nWe can conclude that the dose has an effect on the growth.\n",
